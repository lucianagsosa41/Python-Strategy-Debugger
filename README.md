# ðŸ§  Python Strategy Debugger & Mini Backtester  

Project developed by **Luciana Sosa (2025)** as a technical demo to showcase how I structure a **Python + N8n** workflow focused on **debugging, validation, and backtesting** of trading or logic-based strategies.  

Designed for **portfolio and professional practice purposes**, inspired by real-world **automation and AI-assisted workflow** projects.

## ðŸš€ Overview

This mini-framework allows you to:
- Validate financial (OHLC) datasets.  
- Execute Python-based strategies and capture errors or traces.  
- Perform a basic backtest (cumulative return, drawdown, ratio).  
- Automatically generate both **JSON** and **human-readable** reports.  

The workflow is structured to be easily **integrated into N8n** or any orchestration tool (Make, Airflow, etc.), dividing the process into modular steps or nodes.
